(TSLA)?Musk Will Boost Tesla Over the Long Term, Munster Says\\\"Over the longer term, Musk will do what's right for Tesla,\\\" Munster stated. The analyst suggested that the company's increased emphasis on autonomous driving and robotics will ultimately lift its shares.On the other hand, he thinks that the company's financials will deteriorate this year and warned that the shares could drop further in 2025. Indeed, according to Munster, Musk recently hinted that the company's financials are likely to weaken in 2025 when he said that its performance over the next 6 to 12 months is \\\"difficult to predict.\\\"However, Munster, noting that the shares still have a very high forward price-earnings ratio, argued that investors continue to believe in Musk and his strategy.More About TeslaAnalysts on average expect the company's earnings per share to climb to $2.66 this year from $2.42 last year. In 2026, the mean estimate calls for its EPS to rise to $3.58.According to Yahoo Finance, the shares have a forward P/E ratio of 97 times.While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

HSBC analysts, led by Michael Tyndall, pointed to deeper-rooted issues in Tesla's business beyond recent brand concerns. In China, the company is facing stiff competition due to aging vehicle models and limited driving-assistance features.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with ADCOF.In Europe, Tyndall highlighted brand perception struggles as another pressure point. He noted that Tesla's approach, avoiding frequent model updates and holding list prices steady, has so far cushioned the impact, but intensifying competition could make this strategy less effective.The much-anticipated robotaxi venture is seen as too distant to offset these challenges. Tyndall added that repeated delays have plagued Tesla's development timeline, while rivals continue to strengthen their positions.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.View CommentsTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore InfoRecommended Stories\"\n",

Geneva Is Feeling the Impact.These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship StrikesThe electric vehicle maker has large factories in California and Texas that churn out all the cars it sells in the US, insulating it to a greater degree from Trump\\u2019s new levies on auto imports and key components. Major rivals from South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co. to Germany\\u2019s Volkswagen AG and America\\u2019s own General Motors Co. meanwhile will soon face sharply higher costs.\\u201cThere are very few winners,\\u201d Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview. \\u201cConsumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.\\u201dSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bTesla is the \\u201cleast exposed\\u201d to the new duties due to its domestic manufacturing operations, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an analysis this week. Tesla itself has been boasting this week about its US credentials, saying in a post on X that its models \\u201care the most American-made cars.\\u201dStill, Musk says that Tesla won\\u2019t go entirely unscathed. In an X post on Wednesday, he described the tariffs as having a \\u201csignificant\\u201d impact on the company. In a later X post to another user, Musk added that the tariffs will have a \\u201cnot trivial\\u201d effect on the prices of the imported car parts Tesla uses.Between 60% and 75% of the components Tesla uses are manufactured in the US, depending on the model, according to a 2024 filing by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with the majority of the remaining parts sourced from Mexico. But with the value of the imported parts unclear, the financial impact on Tesla is unknown.Ford Motor Co. could also face a less-severe impact than some rivals, with about 80% of the cars it sells in the US being built domestically.The divide showed in the reaction from investors. Tesla surged 5.7% to $287.49 as of 10:47 a.m. Thursday in New York, leading the Nasdaq 100 index of large non-financial companies. Ford fell 3.1%, GM dropped 7.4% and Stellantis NV lost 2.5%.Starting next week, the new 25% tariffs will apply to all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key parts like engines, transmissions and electrical components, on top of any duties already in effect. The levies will only apply to the non-US share of vehicles and parts imported under a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.Story ContinuesThat stands to soften the blow for vehicles whose supply lines zig-zag across the continent. Tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the trade deal also won\\u2019t take effect until the US sets up a process to collect those levies.The US neighbors could use that window to try to stave off full implementation, even if it\\u2019s a long shot.The move is nonetheless a broadside against the continent\\u2019s free-trade agreement that Trump renegotiated during his first term in office that has given rise to a closely integrated supply chain spanning North America. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \\u201cdirect attack.\\u201dForeign brands heavily reliant on imported vehicles will face the most pressure. South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai risks being among the hardest hit. Although the carmaker and its affiliate Kia have plants in Alabama and Georgia \\u2014 and announced a $21 billion US expansion plan this week \\u2014 it imported more than a million vehicles to the US last year, accounting for more than half of its sales in the country, according to figures from Global Data.Hyundai \\u201cremains committed to the long-term growth of the US automotive industry through localized production and innovation,\\u201d the company said in a statement, noting it employs 570,000 people in the US.Hyundai and Kia may have to pay as much as 10 trillion won ($7 billion) every year for tariffs to the US if the 25% tariffs are executed, according to Hyuk Jin Yoon, Seoul-based analyst at SK Securities Co. That accounts for nearly 40% of total operating profit that the two carmakers earned in 2024.And despite having four assembly plants spread across Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas, plus engine plants in West Virginia and Alabama, Toyota Motor Corp., the world\\u2019s biggest automaker, imports about half of what it sells in the US. A representative of Toyota said that the company\\u2019s Mexico operations are 100% compliant with the USMCA free-trade agreement.The tariffs could reduce Toyota\\u2019s estimated operating profit for the 2026 fiscal year by 6%, according to Goldman Sachs Japan analysts including Kota Yuzawa. Embattled Nissan Motor Co. is likely to be the hardest hit among major Japanese automakers, according to their note, with its estimated operating profit likely to be reduced by 56%.Subaru Corp. is considering how to minimize the impact of the tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday, without elaborating on specific measures it\\u2019s looking at. Subaru could see its 2026 operating profit decline 23%, according to the Goldman Sachs note.Detroit\\u2019s carmakers weren\\u2019t spared, either. GM imports some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks from plants in Mexico and Canada, the entry-level Chevy Trax compact SUV from South Korea and its family car, the Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV. Last year GM sold more than 200,000 each of the Equinox and Trax, which are among its cheapest vehicles. The automaker also makes electric versions of the Equinox and Blazer in Mexico.Stellantis makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S SUVs in Mexico. The company imports its Chrysler Pacifica minivans from Canada and compact Dodge Hornet and Fiat 500 from Italy.And even though Ford is more US-reliant than its cross-town rivals, it faces pain of its own. The carmaker builds its entry-level Maverick small pickup in Mexico as well as the Bronco Sport compact SUV and Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle.Trump on Wednesday insisted that there\\u2019s no conflict of interest despite the Tesla chief executive\\u2019s prominent role in the administration.\\u201cHe\\u2019s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,\\u201d Trump said at an Oval Office event on Wednesday as he signed the proclamation putting the auto tariffs in place.--With assistance from Keith Naughton, Heejin Kim, Kara Carlson, Amy Stillman, Linda Lew and Brandon Harden.(Updates share trading in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBusiness Schools Are BackGoogle Is Searching for an Answer to ChatGPTA New \\u2018China Shock\\u2019 Is Destroying Jobs Around the WorldThe Richest Americans Kept the Economy Booming.

Market Open.TSLAGMAdvanced ChartThe main reason tariffs aren't likely to affect Tesla is the company's localized manufacturing. Though the company operates gigafactories in China and Germany, none of the EVs built there are sold in the US.Tesla's US-sold vehicles are made exclusively at the company's Fremont, Calif., location or at Giga Austin in Texas. Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are the only other automakers that make 100% of their vehicles in the US for US buyers. By comparison, 77% of Ford's autos are made in the US, followed by Stellantis (57%), Nissan (52%), and GM (52%).Read more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffsTD Cowen's Itay Michaeli thinks this makes Tesla a \\\"relative winner\\\" in the tariff wars.\\\"Tesla a relative beneficiary given 100% US production footprint, substantial US sourcing and with Model Y competing in a midsize crossover segment where close to ~50% of vehicles could be subject to tariffs,\\\" Michaeli wrote Thursday morning.Trump said in his news conference last night that he didn't consult Musk about the auto tariffs because the CEO \\\"may have a conflict.\\\"Despite Tesla being a relative winner in the situation, some company execs are a little worried. In anunsigned letter submitted last week to US trade representative Jamieson Greer, the company warned tariffs could lead to retaliation from US export partners and higher prices for parts that can only be sourced internationally.Musk addedlast night on Xthat Tesla is \\\"NOT unscathed here\\\" and that the impact of tariffs on the company is \\\"still significant.\\\"Investors, at least at this point, disagree with Musk's outward assertion, though the CEO did not elaborate how or why the impact would be \\\"significant.\\\"Tesla, Trump, and the EV tax creditTesla Cybertruck on display at a dealership. Tesla offers the Cybertruck with a driving range of up to 340 miles.\\u00b7jetcityimage via Getty ImagesOne area that might concern Musk and Tesla is the future of the federal EV tax credit that allows for $7,500 rebates to consumers who buy or lease pure EVs.Tesla likely would not exist if not for that tax credit, which the company availed itself to for years during the Obama administration. The EV tax credit was extended and enhanced in President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act signed in 2022.Story ContinuesBut now that Tesla can produce its EVs profitability \\u2014 and is essentially a cost leader in the space \\u2014 Musk is fine with Trump and a GOP-led Congress potentially pulling the EV tax credit benefit, to the chagrin of his competitors.\\\"I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly.

HSBC analysts, led by Michael Tyndall, pointed to deeper-rooted issues in Tesla's business beyond recent brand concerns. In China, the company is facing stiff competition due to aging vehicle models and limited driving-assistance features.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with ADCOF.In Europe, Tyndall highlighted brand perception struggles as another pressure point. He noted that Tesla's approach, avoiding frequent model updates and holding list prices steady, has so far cushioned the impact, but intensifying competition could make this strategy less effective.The much-anticipated robotaxi venture is seen as too distant to offset these challenges. Tyndall added that repeated delays have plagued Tesla's development timeline, while rivals continue to strengthen their positions.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.View CommentsTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore InfoRecommended Stories\"\n",

Now the Mall Is Dying.Why Did the Government Declare War on My Adorable Tiny Truck?How SUVs Are Making Traffic WorseTrump Slashed International Aid. Geneva Is Feeling the Impact.These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship StrikesThe electric vehicle maker has large factories in California and Texas that churn out all the cars it sells in the US, insulating it to a greater degree from Trump\\u2019s new levies on auto imports and key components. Major rivals from South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co. to Germany\\u2019s Volkswagen AG and America\\u2019s own General Motors Co. meanwhile will soon face sharply higher costs.\\u201cThere are very few winners,\\u201d Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview. \\u201cConsumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.\\u201dSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bTesla is the \\u201cleast exposed\\u201d to the new duties due to its domestic manufacturing operations, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an analysis this week. Tesla itself has been boasting this week about its US credentials, saying in a post on X that its models \\u201care the most American-made cars.\\u201dStill, Musk says that Tesla won\\u2019t go entirely unscathed. In an X post on Wednesday, he described the tariffs as having a \\u201csignificant\\u201d impact on the company. In a later X post to another user, Musk added that the tariffs will have a \\u201cnot trivial\\u201d effect on the prices of the imported car parts Tesla uses.Between 60% and 75% of the components Tesla uses are manufactured in the US, depending on the model, according to a 2024 filing by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with the majority of the remaining parts sourced from Mexico. But with the value of the imported parts unclear, the financial impact on Tesla is unknown.Ford Motor Co. could also face a less-severe impact than some rivals, with about 80% of the cars it sells in the US being built domestically.The divide showed in the reaction from investors. Tesla surged 5.7% to $287.49 as of 10:47 a.m. Thursday in New York, leading the Nasdaq 100 index of large non-financial companies. Ford fell 3.1%, GM dropped 7.4% and Stellantis NV lost 2.5%.Starting next week, the new 25% tariffs will apply to all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key parts like engines, transmissions and electrical components, on top of any duties already in effect. The levies will only apply to the non-US share of vehicles and parts imported under a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.Story ContinuesThat stands to soften the blow for vehicles whose supply lines zig-zag across the continent. Tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the trade deal also won\\u2019t take effect until the US sets up a process to collect those levies.The US neighbors could use that window to try to stave off full implementation, even if it\\u2019s a long shot.The move is nonetheless a broadside against the continent\\u2019s free-trade agreement that Trump renegotiated during his first term in office that has given rise to a closely integrated supply chain spanning North America. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \\u201cdirect attack.\\u201dForeign brands heavily reliant on imported vehicles will face the most pressure. South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai risks being among the hardest hit. Although the carmaker and its affiliate Kia have plants in Alabama and Georgia \\u2014 and announced a $21 billion US expansion plan this week \\u2014 it imported more than a million vehicles to the US last year, accounting for more than half of its sales in the country, according to figures from Global Data.Hyundai \\u201cremains committed to the long-term growth of the US automotive industry through localized production and innovation,\\u201d the company said in a statement, noting it employs 570,000 people in the US.Hyundai and Kia may have to pay as much as 10 trillion won ($7 billion) every year for tariffs to the US if the 25% tariffs are executed, according to Hyuk Jin Yoon, Seoul-based analyst at SK Securities Co. That accounts for nearly 40% of total operating profit that the two carmakers earned in 2024.And despite having four assembly plants spread across Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas, plus engine plants in West Virginia and Alabama, Toyota Motor Corp., the world\\u2019s biggest automaker, imports about half of what it sells in the US. A representative of Toyota said that the company\\u2019s Mexico operations are 100% compliant with the USMCA free-trade agreement.The tariffs could reduce Toyota\\u2019s estimated operating profit for the 2026 fiscal year by 6%, according to Goldman Sachs Japan analysts including Kota Yuzawa. Embattled Nissan Motor Co. is likely to be the hardest hit among major Japanese automakers, according to their note, with its estimated operating profit likely to be reduced by 56%.Subaru Corp. is considering how to minimize the impact of the tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday, without elaborating on specific measures it\\u2019s looking at. Subaru could see its 2026 operating profit decline 23%, according to the Goldman Sachs note.Detroit\\u2019s carmakers weren\\u2019t spared, either. GM imports some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks from plants in Mexico and Canada, the entry-level Chevy Trax compact SUV from South Korea and its family car, the Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV. Last year GM sold more than 200,000 each of the Equinox and Trax, which are among its cheapest vehicles. The automaker also makes electric versions of the Equinox and Blazer in Mexico.Stellantis makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S SUVs in Mexico. The company imports its Chrysler Pacifica minivans from Canada and compact Dodge Hornet and Fiat 500 from Italy.And even though Ford is more US-reliant than its cross-town rivals, it faces pain of its own. The carmaker builds its entry-level Maverick small pickup in Mexico as well as the Bronco Sport compact SUV and Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle.Trump on Wednesday insisted that there\\u2019s no conflict of interest despite the Tesla chief executive\\u2019s prominent role in the administration.\\u201cHe\\u2019s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,\\u201d Trump said at an Oval Office event on Wednesday as he signed the proclamation putting the auto tariffs in place.--With assistance from Keith Naughton, Heejin Kim, Kara Carlson, Amy Stillman, Linda Lew and Brandon Harden.(Updates share trading in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBusiness Schools Are BackGoogle Is Searching for an Answer to ChatGPTA New \\u2018China Shock\\u2019 Is Destroying Jobs Around the WorldThe Richest Americans Kept the Economy Booming.

Though the company operates gigafactories in China and Germany, none of the EVs built there are sold in the US.Tesla's US-sold vehicles are made exclusively at the company's Fremont, Calif., location or at Giga Austin in Texas. Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are the only other automakers that make 100% of their vehicles in the US for US buyers.

In anunsigned letter submitted last week to US trade representative Jamieson Greer, the company warned tariffs could lead to retaliation from US export partners and higher prices for parts that can only be sourced internationally.Musk addedlast night on Xthat Tesla is \\\"NOT unscathed here\\\" and that the impact of tariffs on the company is \\\"still significant.\\\"Investors, at least at this point, disagree with Musk's outward assertion, though the CEO did not elaborate how or why the impact would be \\\"significant.\\\"Tesla, Trump, and the EV tax creditTesla Cybertruck on display at a dealership.

The EV tax credit was extended and enhanced in President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act signed in 2022.Story ContinuesBut now that Tesla can produce its EVs profitability \\u2014 and is essentially a cost leader in the space \\u2014 Musk is fine with Trump and a GOP-led Congress potentially pulling the EV tax credit benefit, to the chagrin of his competitors.\\\"I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly.

(TSLA)?Musk Will Boost Tesla Over the Long Term, Munster Says\\\"Over the longer term, Musk will do what's right for Tesla,\\\" Munster stated. The analyst suggested that the company's increased emphasis on autonomous driving and robotics will ultimately lift its shares.On the other hand, he thinks that the company's financials will deteriorate this year and warned that the shares could drop further in 2025. Indeed, according to Munster, Musk recently hinted that the company's financials are likely to weaken in 2025 when he said that its performance over the next 6 to 12 months is \\\"difficult to predict.\\\"However, Munster, noting that the shares still have a very high forward price-earnings ratio, argued that investors continue to believe in Musk and his strategy.More About TeslaAnalysts on average expect the company's earnings per share to climb to $2.66 this year from $2.42 last year.

HSBC analysts, led by Michael Tyndall, pointed to deeper-rooted issues in Tesla's business beyond recent brand concerns. In China, the company is facing stiff competition due to aging vehicle models and limited driving-assistance features.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with ADCOF.In Europe, Tyndall highlighted brand perception struggles as another pressure point. He noted that Tesla's approach, avoiding frequent model updates and holding list prices steady, has so far cushioned the impact, but intensifying competition could make this strategy less effective.The much-anticipated robotaxi venture is seen as too distant to offset these challenges. Tyndall added that repeated delays have plagued Tesla's development timeline, while rivals continue to strengthen their positions.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.View CommentsTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore InfoRecommended Stories\"\n",

Geneva Is Feeling the Impact.These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship StrikesThe electric vehicle maker has large factories in California and Texas that churn out all the cars it sells in the US, insulating it to a greater degree from Trump\\u2019s new levies on auto imports and key components. Major rivals from South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co. to Germany\\u2019s Volkswagen AG and America\\u2019s own General Motors Co. meanwhile will soon face sharply higher costs.\\u201cThere are very few winners,\\u201d Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview. \\u201cConsumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.\\u201dSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bTesla is the \\u201cleast exposed\\u201d to the new duties due to its domestic manufacturing operations, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an analysis this week. Tesla itself has been boasting this week about its US credentials, saying in a post on X that its models \\u201care the most American-made cars.\\u201dStill, Musk says that Tesla won\\u2019t go entirely unscathed. In an X post on Wednesday, he described the tariffs as having a \\u201csignificant\\u201d impact on the company. In a later X post to another user, Musk added that the tariffs will have a \\u201cnot trivial\\u201d effect on the prices of the imported car parts Tesla uses.Between 60% and 75% of the components Tesla uses are manufactured in the US, depending on the model, according to a 2024 filing by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with the majority of the remaining parts sourced from Mexico. But with the value of the imported parts unclear, the financial impact on Tesla is unknown.Ford Motor Co. could also face a less-severe impact than some rivals, with about 80% of the cars it sells in the US being built domestically.The divide showed in the reaction from investors. Tesla surged 5.7% to $287.49 as of 10:47 a.m. Thursday in New York, leading the Nasdaq 100 index of large non-financial companies. Ford fell 3.1%, GM dropped 7.4% and Stellantis NV lost 2.5%.Starting next week, the new 25% tariffs will apply to all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key parts like engines, transmissions and electrical components, on top of any duties already in effect. The levies will only apply to the non-US share of vehicles and parts imported under a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.Story ContinuesThat stands to soften the blow for vehicles whose supply lines zig-zag across the continent. Tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the trade deal also won\\u2019t take effect until the US sets up a process to collect those levies.The US neighbors could use that window to try to stave off full implementation, even if it\\u2019s a long shot.The move is nonetheless a broadside against the continent\\u2019s free-trade agreement that Trump renegotiated during his first term in office that has given rise to a closely integrated supply chain spanning North America. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \\u201cdirect attack.\\u201dForeign brands heavily reliant on imported vehicles will face the most pressure. South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai risks being among the hardest hit. Although the carmaker and its affiliate Kia have plants in Alabama and Georgia \\u2014 and announced a $21 billion US expansion plan this week \\u2014 it imported more than a million vehicles to the US last year, accounting for more than half of its sales in the country, according to figures from Global Data.Hyundai \\u201cremains committed to the long-term growth of the US automotive industry through localized production and innovation,\\u201d the company said in a statement, noting it employs 570,000 people in the US.Hyundai and Kia may have to pay as much as 10 trillion won ($7 billion) every year for tariffs to the US if the 25% tariffs are executed, according to Hyuk Jin Yoon, Seoul-based analyst at SK Securities Co. That accounts for nearly 40% of total operating profit that the two carmakers earned in 2024.And despite having four assembly plants spread across Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas, plus engine plants in West Virginia and Alabama, Toyota Motor Corp., the world\\u2019s biggest automaker, imports about half of what it sells in the US. A representative of Toyota said that the company\\u2019s Mexico operations are 100% compliant with the USMCA free-trade agreement.The tariffs could reduce Toyota\\u2019s estimated operating profit for the 2026 fiscal year by 6%, according to Goldman Sachs Japan analysts including Kota Yuzawa. Embattled Nissan Motor Co. is likely to be the hardest hit among major Japanese automakers, according to their note, with its estimated operating profit likely to be reduced by 56%.Subaru Corp. is considering how to minimize the impact of the tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday, without elaborating on specific measures it\\u2019s looking at. Subaru could see its 2026 operating profit decline 23%, according to the Goldman Sachs note.Detroit\\u2019s carmakers weren\\u2019t spared, either. GM imports some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks from plants in Mexico and Canada, the entry-level Chevy Trax compact SUV from South Korea and its family car, the Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV. Last year GM sold more than 200,000 each of the Equinox and Trax, which are among its cheapest vehicles. The automaker also makes electric versions of the Equinox and Blazer in Mexico.Stellantis makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S SUVs in Mexico. The company imports its Chrysler Pacifica minivans from Canada and compact Dodge Hornet and Fiat 500 from Italy.And even though Ford is more US-reliant than its cross-town rivals, it faces pain of its own. The carmaker builds its entry-level Maverick small pickup in Mexico as well as the Bronco Sport compact SUV and Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle.Trump on Wednesday insisted that there\\u2019s no conflict of interest despite the Tesla chief executive\\u2019s prominent role in the administration.\\u201cHe\\u2019s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,\\u201d Trump said at an Oval Office event on Wednesday as he signed the proclamation putting the auto tariffs in place.--With assistance from Keith Naughton, Heejin Kim, Kara Carlson, Amy Stillman, Linda Lew and Brandon Harden.(Updates share trading in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBusiness Schools Are BackGoogle Is Searching for an Answer to ChatGPTA New \\u2018China Shock\\u2019 Is Destroying Jobs Around the WorldThe Richest Americans Kept the Economy Booming.

Though the company operates gigafactories in China and Germany, none of the EVs built there are sold in the US.Tesla's US-sold vehicles are made exclusively at the company's Fremont, Calif., location or at Giga Austin in Texas. Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are the only other automakers that make 100% of their vehicles in the US for US buyers. By comparison, 77% of Ford's autos are made in the US, followed by Stellantis (57%), Nissan (52%), and GM (52%).Read more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffsTD Cowen's Itay Michaeli thinks this makes Tesla a \\\"relative winner\\\" in the tariff wars.\\\"Tesla a relative beneficiary given 100% US production footprint, substantial US sourcing and with Model Y competing in a midsize crossover segment where close to ~50% of vehicles could be subject to tariffs,\\\" Michaeli wrote Thursday morning.Trump said in his news conference last night that he didn't consult Musk about the auto tariffs because the CEO \\\"may have a conflict.\\\"Despite Tesla being a relative winner in the situation, some company execs are a little worried.

HSBC analysts, led by Michael Tyndall, pointed to deeper-rooted issues in Tesla's business beyond recent brand concerns. In China, the company is facing stiff competition due to aging vehicle models and limited driving-assistance features.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with ADCOF.In Europe, Tyndall highlighted brand perception struggles as another pressure point. He noted that Tesla's approach, avoiding frequent model updates and holding list prices steady, has so far cushioned the impact, but intensifying competition could make this strategy less effective.The much-anticipated robotaxi venture is seen as too distant to offset these challenges. Tyndall added that repeated delays have plagued Tesla's development timeline, while rivals continue to strengthen their positions.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.View CommentsTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore InfoRecommended Stories\"\n",

Geneva Is Feeling the Impact.These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship StrikesThe electric vehicle maker has large factories in California and Texas that churn out all the cars it sells in the US, insulating it to a greater degree from Trump\\u2019s new levies on auto imports and key components. Major rivals from South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co. to Germany\\u2019s Volkswagen AG and America\\u2019s own General Motors Co. meanwhile will soon face sharply higher costs.\\u201cThere are very few winners,\\u201d Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview. \\u201cConsumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.\\u201dSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bTesla is the \\u201cleast exposed\\u201d to the new duties due to its domestic manufacturing operations, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an analysis this week. Tesla itself has been boasting this week about its US credentials, saying in a post on X that its models \\u201care the most American-made cars.\\u201dStill, Musk says that Tesla won\\u2019t go entirely unscathed. In an X post on Wednesday, he described the tariffs as having a \\u201csignificant\\u201d impact on the company. In a later X post to another user, Musk added that the tariffs will have a \\u201cnot trivial\\u201d effect on the prices of the imported car parts Tesla uses.Between 60% and 75% of the components Tesla uses are manufactured in the US, depending on the model, according to a 2024 filing by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with the majority of the remaining parts sourced from Mexico. But with the value of the imported parts unclear, the financial impact on Tesla is unknown.Ford Motor Co. could also face a less-severe impact than some rivals, with about 80% of the cars it sells in the US being built domestically.The divide showed in the reaction from investors. Tesla surged 5.7% to $287.49 as of 10:47 a.m. Thursday in New York, leading the Nasdaq 100 index of large non-financial companies. Ford fell 3.1%, GM dropped 7.4% and Stellantis NV lost 2.5%.Starting next week, the new 25% tariffs will apply to all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key parts like engines, transmissions and electrical components, on top of any duties already in effect. The levies will only apply to the non-US share of vehicles and parts imported under a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.Story ContinuesThat stands to soften the blow for vehicles whose supply lines zig-zag across the continent. Tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the trade deal also won\\u2019t take effect until the US sets up a process to collect those levies.The US neighbors could use that window to try to stave off full implementation, even if it\\u2019s a long shot.The move is nonetheless a broadside against the continent\\u2019s free-trade agreement that Trump renegotiated during his first term in office that has given rise to a closely integrated supply chain spanning North America. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \\u201cdirect attack.\\u201dForeign brands heavily reliant on imported vehicles will face the most pressure. South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai risks being among the hardest hit. Although the carmaker and its affiliate Kia have plants in Alabama and Georgia \\u2014 and announced a $21 billion US expansion plan this week \\u2014 it imported more than a million vehicles to the US last year, accounting for more than half of its sales in the country, according to figures from Global Data.Hyundai \\u201cremains committed to the long-term growth of the US automotive industry through localized production and innovation,\\u201d the company said in a statement, noting it employs 570,000 people in the US.Hyundai and Kia may have to pay as much as 10 trillion won ($7 billion) every year for tariffs to the US if the 25% tariffs are executed, according to Hyuk Jin Yoon, Seoul-based analyst at SK Securities Co. That accounts for nearly 40% of total operating profit that the two carmakers earned in 2024.And despite having four assembly plants spread across Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas, plus engine plants in West Virginia and Alabama, Toyota Motor Corp., the world\\u2019s biggest automaker, imports about half of what it sells in the US. A representative of Toyota said that the company\\u2019s Mexico operations are 100% compliant with the USMCA free-trade agreement.The tariffs could reduce Toyota\\u2019s estimated operating profit for the 2026 fiscal year by 6%, according to Goldman Sachs Japan analysts including Kota Yuzawa. Embattled Nissan Motor Co. is likely to be the hardest hit among major Japanese automakers, according to their note, with its estimated operating profit likely to be reduced by 56%.Subaru Corp. is considering how to minimize the impact of the tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday, without elaborating on specific measures it\\u2019s looking at. Subaru could see its 2026 operating profit decline 23%, according to the Goldman Sachs note.Detroit\\u2019s carmakers weren\\u2019t spared, either. GM imports some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks from plants in Mexico and Canada, the entry-level Chevy Trax compact SUV from South Korea and its family car, the Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV. Last year GM sold more than 200,000 each of the Equinox and Trax, which are among its cheapest vehicles. The automaker also makes electric versions of the Equinox and Blazer in Mexico.Stellantis makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S SUVs in Mexico.

This suggests that the majority of news coverage about Tesla is favorable, which could have a positive impact on the company's stock price and overall market perception.\\n\\nThe presence of neutral and negative articles may indicate that there are some concerns or controversies surrounding the company, but the overall positive sentiment suggests that these issues are not significant enough to outweigh the positive news.\\n\\nIn terms of potential market implications, the positive sentiment towards Tesla could lead to:\\n\\n* Increased investor confidence, potentially driving up the stock price\\n* Improved brand reputation, which could lead to increased sales and market share\\n* Enhanced credibility for the company's products and services, particularly in the electric vehicle (EV) market\\n\\nHowever, it's essential to note that the market is influenced by a wide range of factors, and a single sentiment analysis may not be enough to predict market movements. Other factors, such as economic conditions, industry trends, and competitor activity, also play a significant role in shaping market sentiment.\\n\\nOverall, the positive sentiment towards Tesla suggests that the company is likely to continue to be a major player in the EV market and may experience continued growth and success.\"\n",

Market Open.TSLAGMAdvanced ChartThe main reason tariffs aren't likely to affect Tesla is the company's localized manufacturing. Though the company operates gigafactories in China and Germany, none of the EVs built there are sold in the US.Tesla's US-sold vehicles are made exclusively at the company's Fremont, Calif., location or at Giga Austin in Texas. Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID) are the only other automakers that make 100% of their vehicles in the US for US buyers. By comparison, 77% of Ford's autos are made in the US, followed by Stellantis (57%), Nissan (52%), and GM (52%).Read more:The latest news and updates on Trump's tariffsTD Cowen's Itay Michaeli thinks this makes Tesla a \\\"relative winner\\\" in the tariff wars.\\\"Tesla a relative beneficiary given 100% US production footprint, substantial US sourcing and with Model Y competing in a midsize crossover segment where close to ~50% of vehicles could be subject to tariffs,\\\" Michaeli wrote Thursday morning.Trump said in his news conference last night that he didn't consult Musk about the auto tariffs because the CEO \\\"may have a conflict.\\\"Despite Tesla being a relative winner in the situation, some company execs are a little worried. In anunsigned letter submitted last week to US trade representative Jamieson Greer, the company warned tariffs could lead to retaliation from US export partners and higher prices for parts that can only be sourced internationally.Musk addedlast night on Xthat Tesla is \\\"NOT unscathed here\\\" and that the impact of tariffs on the company is \\\"still significant.\\\"Investors, at least at this point, disagree with Musk's outward assertion, though the CEO did not elaborate how or why the impact would be \\\"significant.\\\"Tesla, Trump, and the EV tax creditTesla Cybertruck on display at a dealership. Tesla offers the Cybertruck with a driving range of up to 340 miles.\\u00b7jetcityimage via Getty ImagesOne area that might concern Musk and Tesla is the future of the federal EV tax credit that allows for $7,500 rebates to consumers who buy or lease pure EVs.Tesla likely would not exist if not for that tax credit, which the company availed itself to for years during the Obama administration. The EV tax credit was extended and enhanced in President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act signed in 2022.Story ContinuesBut now that Tesla can produce its EVs profitability \\u2014 and is essentially a cost leader in the space \\u2014 Musk is fine with Trump and a GOP-led Congress potentially pulling the EV tax credit benefit, to the chagrin of his competitors.\\\"I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly. But long term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess,\\\" Musk said when asked about the future of the tax credits during Tesla's Q2 earnings call last year.MostWall Street analysts and economistsbelieve a loss of EV tax credits would hurt Tesla sales, though it would hurt its competitors more.But perhaps the biggest reasons Tesla and Musk support Trump are self-driving and autonomy.A line of Tesla Cybercab robotaxis.

And Tesla bulls likeAdam Jonas at Morgan StanleyandDan Ives at Wedbushsee that as the main driver of Tesla's future growth.Musk, not surprisingly, agrees.\\\"The value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are, I think, no way it's relative to autonomy,\\\" Musk said during last year's Q2 call. \\\"I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla would solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock.\\\"\\\"If you believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock.

HSBC analysts, led by Michael Tyndall, pointed to deeper-rooted issues in Tesla's business beyond recent brand concerns. In China, the company is facing stiff competition due to aging vehicle models and limited driving-assistance features.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with ADCOF.In Europe, Tyndall highlighted brand perception struggles as another pressure point. He noted that Tesla's approach, avoiding frequent model updates and holding list prices steady, has so far cushioned the impact, but intensifying competition could make this strategy less effective.The much-anticipated robotaxi venture is seen as too distant to offset these challenges. Tyndall added that repeated delays have plagued Tesla's development timeline, while rivals continue to strengthen their positions.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.View CommentsTermsandPrivacy PolicyPrivacy DashboardMore InfoRecommended Stories\"\n",

Now the Mall Is Dying.Why Did the Government Declare War on My Adorable Tiny Truck?How SUVs Are Making Traffic WorseTrump Slashed International Aid. Geneva Is Feeling the Impact.These US Bridges Face High Risk of Catastrophic Ship StrikesThe electric vehicle maker has large factories in California and Texas that churn out all the cars it sells in the US, insulating it to a greater degree from Trump\\u2019s new levies on auto imports and key components. Major rivals from South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai Motor Co. to Germany\\u2019s Volkswagen AG and America\\u2019s own General Motors Co. meanwhile will soon face sharply higher costs.\\u201cThere are very few winners,\\u201d Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said in a telephone interview. \\u201cConsumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.\\u201dSubscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200bTesla is the \\u201cleast exposed\\u201d to the new duties due to its domestic manufacturing operations, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson wrote in an analysis this week. Tesla itself has been boasting this week about its US credentials, saying in a post on X that its models \\u201care the most American-made cars.\\u201dStill, Musk says that Tesla won\\u2019t go entirely unscathed. In an X post on Wednesday, he described the tariffs as having a \\u201csignificant\\u201d impact on the company. In a later X post to another user, Musk added that the tariffs will have a \\u201cnot trivial\\u201d effect on the prices of the imported car parts Tesla uses.Between 60% and 75% of the components Tesla uses are manufactured in the US, depending on the model, according to a 2024 filing by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with the majority of the remaining parts sourced from Mexico. But with the value of the imported parts unclear, the financial impact on Tesla is unknown.Ford Motor Co. could also face a less-severe impact than some rivals, with about 80% of the cars it sells in the US being built domestically.The divide showed in the reaction from investors. Tesla surged 5.7% to $287.49 as of 10:47 a.m. Thursday in New York, leading the Nasdaq 100 index of large non-financial companies. Ford fell 3.1%, GM dropped 7.4% and Stellantis NV lost 2.5%.Starting next week, the new 25% tariffs will apply to all imported passenger vehicles and light trucks, as well as key parts like engines, transmissions and electrical components, on top of any duties already in effect. The levies will only apply to the non-US share of vehicles and parts imported under a free-trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.Story ContinuesThat stands to soften the blow for vehicles whose supply lines zig-zag across the continent. Tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico that comply with the trade deal also won\\u2019t take effect until the US sets up a process to collect those levies.The US neighbors could use that window to try to stave off full implementation, even if it\\u2019s a long shot.The move is nonetheless a broadside against the continent\\u2019s free-trade agreement that Trump renegotiated during his first term in office that has given rise to a closely integrated supply chain spanning North America. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \\u201cdirect attack.\\u201dForeign brands heavily reliant on imported vehicles will face the most pressure. South Korea\\u2019s Hyundai risks being among the hardest hit. Although the carmaker and its affiliate Kia have plants in Alabama and Georgia \\u2014 and announced a $21 billion US expansion plan this week \\u2014 it imported more than a million vehicles to the US last year, accounting for more than half of its sales in the country, according to figures from Global Data.Hyundai \\u201cremains committed to the long-term growth of the US automotive industry through localized production and innovation,\\u201d the company said in a statement, noting it employs 570,000 people in the US.Hyundai and Kia may have to pay as much as 10 trillion won ($7 billion) every year for tariffs to the US if the 25% tariffs are executed, according to Hyuk Jin Yoon, Seoul-based analyst at SK Securities Co. That accounts for nearly 40% of total operating profit that the two carmakers earned in 2024.And despite having four assembly plants spread across Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi and Texas, plus engine plants in West Virginia and Alabama, Toyota Motor Corp., the world\\u2019s biggest automaker, imports about half of what it sells in the US. A representative of Toyota said that the company\\u2019s Mexico operations are 100% compliant with the USMCA free-trade agreement.The tariffs could reduce Toyota\\u2019s estimated operating profit for the 2026 fiscal year by 6%, according to Goldman Sachs Japan analysts including Kota Yuzawa. Embattled Nissan Motor Co. is likely to be the hardest hit among major Japanese automakers, according to their note, with its estimated operating profit likely to be reduced by 56%.Subaru Corp. is considering how to minimize the impact of the tariffs, a company spokesperson said Thursday, without elaborating on specific measures it\\u2019s looking at. Subaru could see its 2026 operating profit decline 23%, according to the Goldman Sachs note.Detroit\\u2019s carmakers weren\\u2019t spared, either. GM imports some Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks from plants in Mexico and Canada, the entry-level Chevy Trax compact SUV from South Korea and its family car, the Chevrolet Equinox crossover SUV. Last year GM sold more than 200,000 each of the Equinox and Trax, which are among its cheapest vehicles. The automaker also makes electric versions of the Equinox and Blazer in Mexico.Stellantis makes the Jeep Compass and Wagoneer S SUVs in Mexico. The company imports its Chrysler Pacifica minivans from Canada and compact Dodge Hornet and Fiat 500 from Italy.And even though Ford is more US-reliant than its cross-town rivals, it faces pain of its own. The carmaker builds its entry-level Maverick small pickup in Mexico as well as the Bronco Sport compact SUV and Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle.Trump on Wednesday insisted that there\\u2019s no conflict of interest despite the Tesla chief executive\\u2019s prominent role in the administration.\\u201cHe\\u2019s never asked me for a favor in business whatsoever,\\u201d Trump said at an Oval Office event on Wednesday as he signed the proclamation putting the auto tariffs in place.--With assistance from Keith Naughton, Heejin Kim, Kara Carlson, Amy Stillman, Linda Lew and Brandon Harden.(Updates share trading in eighth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekBusiness Schools Are BackGoogle Is Searching for an Answer to ChatGPTA New \\u2018China Shock\\u2019 Is Destroying Jobs Around the WorldThe Richest Americans Kept the Economy Booming.

The negative articles (2 out of 10) may be a result of specific issues or controversies that have been reported.\\n\\nFrom a market perspective, this positive sentiment could have a positive impact on Tesla's stock price and overall market perception. Investors may be more likely to view the company favorably and consider investing in its shares. Additionally, the positive sentiment could also lead to increased brand loyalty and customer confidence, which could drive sales and revenue growth.\\n\\nHowever, it's essential to note that the market is influenced by a wide range of factors, and a single sentiment analysis may not be enough to predict market movements. Other factors such as financial performance, industry trends, and regulatory changes can also impact the stock price.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the overall positive sentiment towards Tesla in the news coverage suggests a favorable market perception, which could have a positive impact on the company's stock price and overall performance.\"\n",
