However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Rating:7/10Open rating explainerInformationWIREDFantastic picture quality for 4K film and TV. Lightning-fast refresh rates, especially for 1080p gaming. Incredible overall performance for the price.TIREDLimited I/O options. No wireless connectivity or apps. Resets keystone when activating signature gaming modes.The home projectorfieldis competitive, so a new contender offering a 120-inch display, 4K resolution with HDR support, and lighting-fast refresh rates makes for an alluring prospect. That Philips is promising all that for under $1,000\\u2014and almost half that on preorder\\u2014almost sounds too good to be true.Philips hasn't been quite as big a player in the projection game as some of its rivals, withits rangefocused on the broadly entry-level NeoPix models and the ultrashort-throw Screeneo laser projectors. The GamePix 900 is something new, emphasizing improved gaming performance even at gigantic scale. It boasts latencies as rapid as 6 milliseconds\\u2014essential for fast-paced gameplay where you want as little input lag from controller-to-screen as possible\\u2014and refresh rates as high as 240 Hz, and it comes with three dedicated display presets: Action Gaming, Adventure Gaming, and Sports Gaming, each tailored for best results in such genres.Anyone who pays attention to the gaming market will likely know that a consistent high frame rate at 4K (or higher) resolution is a bit of a holy grail, something even some of thebest monitorsstruggle to deliver without breaking the bank. Even then, the console or PC running the game needs to be powerful enough to push out ultra high-res frames quickly enough to take advantage of a fast screen. Typically, you'll end up in a middle ground, such as theSamsung Odyssey G6 OLED, which offers an insanely fast 360-Hz refresh rate but a sub-4K display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440.Getting LitAchieving all that, and at this price, is where those few sacrifices come in, as the GamePix 900 is undeniably bare-bones in almost every other respect. Its design is basic, a svelte but uninspiring matte black cuboid (8.6 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches, weighing in at 4.4 pounds), and it has only one adjustable leg to tinker with its physical orientation and throw angle.Photograph: Matt KamenThe GamePix 900 finds itself doing some crafty number-wrangling to justify its lofty specs. While the projector is indeed capable of hitting those buttery-smooth 240-Hz refresh rates and nigh-imperceptible 6-millisecond latencies, it only does so at 1080p resolution. If you want to play anything in actual 4K\\u20143,840 x 2,160p\\u2014then the refresh rate and latency drop accordingly.The trade-off is more than worth it. Playing the likes ofMarvel Rivalsblown up to wall size, at competitive speed with essentially no noticeable lag is a fantastic experience, even if \\u201conly\\u201d in 1080p HD.Still, few owners are likely to use a projector purely for gaming, and overall picture quality proves to be a bit of a secret weapon for the GamePix 900. Both 4K Blu-rays and 4K streamed content from Netflix and Disney+ (all played through a connected PS5) look crystal clear, even at that maximum 120-inch projection.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.While this rig only supports HDR 10, rather than the technically superior Dolby Vision format, colors dazzle too (Philips cites a 95 percentRec. 709color gamut), with a richness and warmth that makes images pop. This feels particularly notable with animated content\\u2014Studio Ghibli'sThe Boy and the Heron, played from 4K UHD, looked nothing short of phenomenal coming out of this projector.Any games that aren't being played at competition level\\u2014so not requiring that 6-millisecond latency\\u2014can take advantage of the full 4K display. Surviving the ruined world ofThe Last of Us Part IIor bouncing aroundAstro Bot'sjoyful cartoon planets has rarely looked so good, especially on this scale. Hooking up a Nintendo Switch, which only has a maximum output resolution of 1080p anyway, looked glorious across the board.Not the BrightestThe only areas where the GamePix 900 really struggles visually are in brightness and black levels. Its 1,000 ANSI lumens output (from an LED bulb with a stated 30,000-hour lifetime) isn't quite powerful enough to make the display stand out in anything other than a darkened room.Photograph: Matt KamenJust a bit of ambient light can prove a problem\\u2014testing outThe Goonieson 4K in the middle of the day made for a washed-out viewing experience, even with curtains closed. And, while no projector can match the true blacks of an OLED panel, darker onscreen areas here can sometimes look a little too muddy or gray, although that can sometimes be mitigated by tweaking the contrast settings. Account for those factors, though, and this really does feel as though it's punching above its weight on the visual front. Frankly, all but thestaunchest of home cinema snobsare likely to be at least a little bit impressed by what this puts out.On the audio front, matters are a bit less exciting, but not disappointing. An internal 5-watt speaker, aided by a sound chamber, is more than up to the job of providinggood enoughaudio in a home setting. There's not much in the way of acoustic nuance\\u2014don't expect great treble or bass\\u2014but it creates a convincing illusion of directionality. A 3.5-mm audio out jack allows room for improvement here too.Plugging InVideo input is limited to a single HDMI port, which means swapping cords around regularly if you want to use more than one device with it. It does, at least, have a USB-A power-out port though, allowing TV sticks to be powered by the projector itself\\u2014useful, since this also lacks any form of wireless connectivity. That means no built-in streaming apps, no Bluetooth pairing, no way to cast devices to the projector, nothing. This may be another area where targeting gamers comes in handy though\\u2014if you have an Xbox or PlayStation connected, you can access all your media apps through that anyway.Photograph: Matt KamenPhilips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.Similarly, almost all ofits lens functionsare entirely physical and can only be adjusted manually. The thrown screen size\\u2014from a minimum 60 inches to that wall-dominating 120 inches\\u2014is altered by turning one dial on the lens itself, the focus of the image by sliding another. There's no automatic keystone detection or correction either, meaning you have to fiddle with the equally bare-bones remote to create a perfectly even-sided frame. If you're setting the GamePix up once and not moving it, this won't be a problem, but otherwise it's a bit annoying.More frustrating is that whenever you switch to one of the gaming presets\\u2014which are effectively this projector's raison d'\\u00eatre\\u2014you're met with a message informing you that \\u201cthe keystone, aspect ratio, overscan, zoom functions will be reset to default.\\u201d This, along with a tendency to automatically drop resolution to 1080p if it can't match a higher frame rate for 4K output (for instance, if a PS5's 120-Hz setting is activated in the console settings) can mean regular menu diving to make sure you're getting the picture quality and presentation that you want.While that might be a deal breaker on a higher-end model, the picture-quality-to-price ratio of the GamePix 900 earns it a lot of forgiveness. At its $999/\\u00a3819 MSRP, the GamePix 900 is already a strong competitor in its bracket. If you can snag it at its preorder price, this 4K projector is almost a no-brainer. While it's unlikely to replace anyone'smain TV\\u2014especially during daylight hours\\u2014the sheer spectacle of having a 120-inch, 4K HDR screen makes it hard to beat for game or movie nights.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.$599at PhilipsMatt Kamenis a freelance journalist specializing in media, video games, and technology coverage.

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.\\u201cThe Strange $55 Million Saga of a Netflix Series You\\u2019ll Never See,\\u201d reported in 2023 by theNew York Times,is now a criminal matter, as today prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkcharged director Carl Erik Rinsch with wire fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They allege that after Netflix (referred to as Streaming Company-1 in the indictment) won the bidding for his 13-episode show, it paid $44 million over the course of 2018 and 2019 to produce the sci-fi series about a species of superintelligent humanlike clones.Accordingto theTimesreport, Netflix secured the show by offering millions more than Amazon and promising Rinsch, whose only feature film is47 Ronin, final cut.The fraud he\\u2019s being charged with came into play once he told Netflix he\\u2019d need an additional $11 million to finish the show, which was originally calledWhite Horsebefore it was renamedConquest. After Netflix sent the money in March of 2020, however, Rinsch allegedly took the money for himself, putting $10.5 million in a brokerage account and losing more than half of it in less than two months while telling Netflix that work on the show was \\u201cawesome and moving forward really well.\\u201dHe had better luck with the rest of the money, making crypto investments starting in the spring of 2021 that prosecutors say \\u201ceventually proved profitable.\\u201d However,as detailed by theTimes, his behavior became erratic, and after Netflix canceled development in 2021, he sent executives emails claiming he\\u2019d found a way to map \\u201cthe coronavirus signal emanating from within the earth\\u201d and told his wife he could predict earthquakes.His crypto speculation went well enough that Rinsch allegedly spent $10 million on himself, including over a million dollars to pay for lawyers to sue Netflix in an attempt to get more money, buy five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, and spend nearly a million bucks on two mattresses, bedding, and linens. According to theTimes, Rinsch claimed they were props for the show, but a mediator who ruled last year that he owed Netflix $12 million decided none of them were necessary for the production.White Horsestill has not been completed.See More:EntertainmentLawNetflixNewsPolicyStreamingMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison Tuohy5:34 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

The streaming service now offers HDR10 Plus through its Premium plan, with the format accounting for around 50 percent of \\u201celigible viewing hours.\\u201dSamsung TVs notably lack support for Dolby Vision, an HDR format with dynamic metadata that optimizes tone and brightness levels for individual scenes.Samsunglaunched HDR10 Plus in 2017, which similarly makes adjustments to tone-mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, but withoutthe royalty payments required for Dolby Vision.HDR10 Plus might be less common than Dolby Vision, but Samsung is the world\\u2019s biggest TV brand, holdinga nearly 30 percent market share.Without support for HDR10 Plus, Samsung TV owners have had to watch content on Netflix with HDR10. Unlike HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, HDR10 uses static metadata for an entire film or TV show, a \\u201cone-size-fits-all\\u201d approach to tone-mapping that could produce less accurate lighting, especially in very bright or very dark scenes.RelatedYou can see Netflix\\u2019s new AV1 streaming tech on select TVs and the PS4 ProThough not many streamers other than Prime Video supported HDR10 Plus at launch, services have gradually hopped on board,including Disney Plus,Apple TV Plus, and now Netflix. Other TVs from Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL also offer HDR10 Plus, but many support Dolby Vision, too.Netflix enabled HDR10 Pluson the AV1 video codec, which means you\\u2019ll need a TV that supports the standard. Most TVs made within the last five years or so have already adopted AV1. The company says it plans on expanding its library of HDR10 Plus content to include all HDR titles by the end of 2025.See More:EntertainmentNetflixNewsSamsungStreamingTechTVsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison TuohyTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.Netflix and other streaming platforms are stepping up efforts to sign YouTubers, which could mean big streaming deals for sports channel Dude Perfect or former NASA engineer Mark Rober,reportsTheWall Street Journal.TheJournalwrites that streaming platforms\\u2019 creator-signing ambitions have \\u201cshifted into overdrive\\u201d in response to the success of MrBeast\\u2019sBeast Games. Amazon has made \\u201cat least $100 million\\u201d in profit from the show and is apparently already working out deals for two more seasons. Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, is apparently asking over $150 million per season to renew.Rober and Dude Perfect have each been approached by Netflix, writes theJournal. But Netflix \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t usually allow for sales promotions in shows that it pays to make\\u201d \\u2014 something that has apparently \\u201cbeen a sticking point\\u201d in its talks with Rober, who sells robotics kit subscriptions through his channel. That sort of thing is more in line with Amazon\\u2019s business, making it a \\u201cparticularly attractive\\u201d option for creators like Rober, the article says.Still, Netflix is no stranger to signing YouTubers. Its2016 deal with Colleen Ballinger Evans, aka Miranda Sings, resulted in one of the first YouTuber-made scripted comedies to make the jump. More recent examples include Netflix\\u2019slive-streamed Jake Paul boxing matchwith Mike Tyson and itsdeal with Ms. Rachel, who has made a name for herself with kid-friendly educational content on YouTube.See More:AmazonCreatorsEntertainmentNetflixStreamingTechYouTubeMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inStreaming0Here are the best streaming service deals available right nowAmazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke steps downSamsung TV owners can finally get better 4K HDR on NetflixIt\\u2019s time to squad up in this preview from Apple\\u2019s Mythic Quest spinoff seriesSeverance brought everything together in its season 2 finaleSeverance is returning for season 30Here are the best streaming service deals available right nowSheena VasaniandCameron Faulkner5:32 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleAmazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke steps downEmma Roth1:30 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleSamsung TV owners can finally get better 4K HDR on NetflixEmma RothMar 25CommentsComment Icon BubbleIt\\u2019s time to squad up in this preview from Apple\\u2019s Mythic Quest spinoff seriesCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleSeverance brought everything together in its season 2 finaleAndrew WebsterMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleSeverance is returning for season 3Emma RothMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",

Dante already has his hands full with the demon White Rabbit (Hoon Lee) and his goons threatening to raze an entire city if their demands aren\\u2019t met.But to make matters even more complicated, human soldiers like Lady (Scout Taylor-Compton) see Dante as a threat due to the demon blood running through his veins.Despite Dante\\u2019s insistence that he isn\\u2019t a monster, all of the high-flying, Studio Mir-produced acrobatics he pulls off definitely make it seem like he\\u2019s got some demonic heritage in the mix. And the look on Dante\\u2019s face when his twin brother Vergil (Robbie Daymond) shows up makes it pretty clear that he\\u2019s hiding something rather explosive about himself. The trailer makes clear that Netflix\\u2019sDevil May Cryis going to be feature elements from the franchise\\u2019s games likeDante\\u2019s Awakeningas well as its official manga (where White Rabbit made his first appearance.) And hopefully, that means the series will feel like more than a one-to-one adaptation when it debuts on April 3rd.See More:EntertainmentGamingNetflixNewsStreamingTrailersTV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inTrailersThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesPowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime moviePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 20CommentsComment Icon BubbleThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesVerge StaffMar 14CommentsComment Icon BubblePowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opAsh ParrishMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubbleWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime movieCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubblePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 12CommentsComment Icon BubbleMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 10CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",

Lightning-fast refresh rates, especially for 1080p gaming. Incredible overall performance for the price.TIREDLimited I/O options. No wireless connectivity or apps. Resets keystone when activating signature gaming modes.The home projectorfieldis competitive, so a new contender offering a 120-inch display, 4K resolution with HDR support, and lighting-fast refresh rates makes for an alluring prospect. That Philips is promising all that for under $1,000\\u2014and almost half that on preorder\\u2014almost sounds too good to be true.Philips hasn't been quite as big a player in the projection game as some of its rivals, withits rangefocused on the broadly entry-level NeoPix models and the ultrashort-throw Screeneo laser projectors. The GamePix 900 is something new, emphasizing improved gaming performance even at gigantic scale. It boasts latencies as rapid as 6 milliseconds\\u2014essential for fast-paced gameplay where you want as little input lag from controller-to-screen as possible\\u2014and refresh rates as high as 240 Hz, and it comes with three dedicated display presets: Action Gaming, Adventure Gaming, and Sports Gaming, each tailored for best results in such genres.Anyone who pays attention to the gaming market will likely know that a consistent high frame rate at 4K (or higher) resolution is a bit of a holy grail, something even some of thebest monitorsstruggle to deliver without breaking the bank. Even then, the console or PC running the game needs to be powerful enough to push out ultra high-res frames quickly enough to take advantage of a fast screen. Typically, you'll end up in a middle ground, such as theSamsung Odyssey G6 OLED, which offers an insanely fast 360-Hz refresh rate but a sub-4K display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440.Getting LitAchieving all that, and at this price, is where those few sacrifices come in, as the GamePix 900 is undeniably bare-bones in almost every other respect. Its design is basic, a svelte but uninspiring matte black cuboid (8.6 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches, weighing in at 4.4 pounds), and it has only one adjustable leg to tinker with its physical orientation and throw angle.Photograph: Matt KamenThe GamePix 900 finds itself doing some crafty number-wrangling to justify its lofty specs. While the projector is indeed capable of hitting those buttery-smooth 240-Hz refresh rates and nigh-imperceptible 6-millisecond latencies, it only does so at 1080p resolution. If you want to play anything in actual 4K\\u20143,840 x 2,160p\\u2014then the refresh rate and latency drop accordingly.The trade-off is more than worth it. Playing the likes ofMarvel Rivalsblown up to wall size, at competitive speed with essentially no noticeable lag is a fantastic experience, even if \\u201conly\\u201d in 1080p HD.Still, few owners are likely to use a projector purely for gaming, and overall picture quality proves to be a bit of a secret weapon for the GamePix 900. Both 4K Blu-rays and 4K streamed content from Netflix and Disney+ (all played through a connected PS5) look crystal clear, even at that maximum 120-inch projection.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.While this rig only supports HDR 10, rather than the technically superior Dolby Vision format, colors dazzle too (Philips cites a 95 percentRec. 709color gamut), with a richness and warmth that makes images pop. This feels particularly notable with animated content\\u2014Studio Ghibli'sThe Boy and the Heron, played from 4K UHD, looked nothing short of phenomenal coming out of this projector.Any games that aren't being played at competition level\\u2014so not requiring that 6-millisecond latency\\u2014can take advantage of the full 4K display. Surviving the ruined world ofThe Last of Us Part IIor bouncing aroundAstro Bot'sjoyful cartoon planets has rarely looked so good, especially on this scale. Hooking up a Nintendo Switch, which only has a maximum output resolution of 1080p anyway, looked glorious across the board.Not the BrightestThe only areas where the GamePix 900 really struggles visually are in brightness and black levels. Its 1,000 ANSI lumens output (from an LED bulb with a stated 30,000-hour lifetime) isn't quite powerful enough to make the display stand out in anything other than a darkened room.Photograph: Matt KamenJust a bit of ambient light can prove a problem\\u2014testing outThe Goonieson 4K in the middle of the day made for a washed-out viewing experience, even with curtains closed. And, while no projector can match the true blacks of an OLED panel, darker onscreen areas here can sometimes look a little too muddy or gray, although that can sometimes be mitigated by tweaking the contrast settings. Account for those factors, though, and this really does feel as though it's punching above its weight on the visual front. Frankly, all but thestaunchest of home cinema snobsare likely to be at least a little bit impressed by what this puts out.On the audio front, matters are a bit less exciting, but not disappointing. An internal 5-watt speaker, aided by a sound chamber, is more than up to the job of providinggood enoughaudio in a home setting. There's not much in the way of acoustic nuance\\u2014don't expect great treble or bass\\u2014but it creates a convincing illusion of directionality. A 3.5-mm audio out jack allows room for improvement here too.Plugging InVideo input is limited to a single HDMI port, which means swapping cords around regularly if you want to use more than one device with it. It does, at least, have a USB-A power-out port though, allowing TV sticks to be powered by the projector itself\\u2014useful, since this also lacks any form of wireless connectivity. That means no built-in streaming apps, no Bluetooth pairing, no way to cast devices to the projector, nothing. This may be another area where targeting gamers comes in handy though\\u2014if you have an Xbox or PlayStation connected, you can access all your media apps through that anyway.Photograph: Matt KamenPhilips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.Similarly, almost all ofits lens functionsare entirely physical and can only be adjusted manually. The thrown screen size\\u2014from a minimum 60 inches to that wall-dominating 120 inches\\u2014is altered by turning one dial on the lens itself, the focus of the image by sliding another. There's no automatic keystone detection or correction either, meaning you have to fiddle with the equally bare-bones remote to create a perfectly even-sided frame. If you're setting the GamePix up once and not moving it, this won't be a problem, but otherwise it's a bit annoying.More frustrating is that whenever you switch to one of the gaming presets\\u2014which are effectively this projector's raison d'\\u00eatre\\u2014you're met with a message informing you that \\u201cthe keystone, aspect ratio, overscan, zoom functions will be reset to default.\\u201d This, along with a tendency to automatically drop resolution to 1080p if it can't match a higher frame rate for 4K output (for instance, if a PS5's 120-Hz setting is activated in the console settings) can mean regular menu diving to make sure you're getting the picture quality and presentation that you want.While that might be a deal breaker on a higher-end model, the picture-quality-to-price ratio of the GamePix 900 earns it a lot of forgiveness. At its $999/\\u00a3819 MSRP, the GamePix 900 is already a strong competitor in its bracket. If you can snag it at its preorder price, this 4K projector is almost a no-brainer. While it's unlikely to replace anyone'smain TV\\u2014especially during daylight hours\\u2014the sheer spectacle of having a 120-inch, 4K HDR screen makes it hard to beat for game or movie nights.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.$599at PhilipsMatt Kamenis a freelance journalist specializing in media, video games, and technology coverage.

They allege that after Netflix (referred to as Streaming Company-1 in the indictment) won the bidding for his 13-episode show, it paid $44 million over the course of 2018 and 2019 to produce the sci-fi series about a species of superintelligent humanlike clones.Accordingto theTimesreport, Netflix secured the show by offering millions more than Amazon and promising Rinsch, whose only feature film is47 Ronin, final cut.The fraud he\\u2019s being charged with came into play once he told Netflix he\\u2019d need an additional $11 million to finish the show, which was originally calledWhite Horsebefore it was renamedConquest. After Netflix sent the money in March of 2020, however, Rinsch allegedly took the money for himself, putting $10.5 million in a brokerage account and losing more than half of it in less than two months while telling Netflix that work on the show was \\u201cawesome and moving forward really well.\\u201dHe had better luck with the rest of the money, making crypto investments starting in the spring of 2021 that prosecutors say \\u201ceventually proved profitable.\\u201d However,as detailed by theTimes, his behavior became erratic, and after Netflix canceled development in 2021, he sent executives emails claiming he\\u2019d found a way to map \\u201cthe coronavirus signal emanating from within the earth\\u201d and told his wife he could predict earthquakes.His crypto speculation went well enough that Rinsch allegedly spent $10 million on himself, including over a million dollars to pay for lawyers to sue Netflix in an attempt to get more money, buy five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, and spend nearly a million bucks on two mattresses, bedding, and linens. According to theTimes, Rinsch claimed they were props for the show, but a mediator who ruled last year that he owed Netflix $12 million decided none of them were necessary for the production.White Horsestill has not been completed.See More:EntertainmentLawNetflixNewsPolicyStreamingMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison Tuohy5:34 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.Netflix hasadded support for HDR10 Plus\\u2013 a move that will finally allow Samsung TV owners to take better advantage of their device\\u2019s ability to stream with better clarity and color. The streaming service now offers HDR10 Plus through its Premium plan, with the format accounting for around 50 percent of \\u201celigible viewing hours.\\u201dSamsung TVs notably lack support for Dolby Vision, an HDR format with dynamic metadata that optimizes tone and brightness levels for individual scenes.Samsunglaunched HDR10 Plus in 2017, which similarly makes adjustments to tone-mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, but withoutthe royalty payments required for Dolby Vision.HDR10 Plus might be less common than Dolby Vision, but Samsung is the world\\u2019s biggest TV brand, holdinga nearly 30 percent market share.Without support for HDR10 Plus, Samsung TV owners have had to watch content on Netflix with HDR10. Unlike HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, HDR10 uses static metadata for an entire film or TV show, a \\u201cone-size-fits-all\\u201d approach to tone-mapping that could produce less accurate lighting, especially in very bright or very dark scenes.RelatedYou can see Netflix\\u2019s new AV1 streaming tech on select TVs and the PS4 ProThough not many streamers other than Prime Video supported HDR10 Plus at launch, services have gradually hopped on board,including Disney Plus,Apple TV Plus, and now Netflix. Other TVs from Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL also offer HDR10 Plus, but many support Dolby Vision, too.Netflix enabled HDR10 Pluson the AV1 video codec, which means you\\u2019ll need a TV that supports the standard. Most TVs made within the last five years or so have already adopted AV1. The company says it plans on expanding its library of HDR10 Plus content to include all HDR titles by the end of 2025.See More:EntertainmentNetflixNewsSamsungStreamingTechTVsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison TuohyTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.Netflix and other streaming platforms are stepping up efforts to sign YouTubers, which could mean big streaming deals for sports channel Dude Perfect or former NASA engineer Mark Rober,reportsTheWall Street Journal.TheJournalwrites that streaming platforms\\u2019 creator-signing ambitions have \\u201cshifted into overdrive\\u201d in response to the success of MrBeast\\u2019sBeast Games. Amazon has made \\u201cat least $100 million\\u201d in profit from the show and is apparently already working out deals for two more seasons. Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, is apparently asking over $150 million per season to renew.Rober and Dude Perfect have each been approached by Netflix, writes theJournal. But Netflix \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t usually allow for sales promotions in shows that it pays to make\\u201d \\u2014 something that has apparently \\u201cbeen a sticking point\\u201d in its talks with Rober, who sells robotics kit subscriptions through his channel. That sort of thing is more in line with Amazon\\u2019s business, making it a \\u201cparticularly attractive\\u201d option for creators like Rober, the article says.Still, Netflix is no stranger to signing YouTubers. Its2016 deal with Colleen Ballinger Evans, aka Miranda Sings, resulted in one of the first YouTuber-made scripted comedies to make the jump. More recent examples include Netflix\\u2019slive-streamed Jake Paul boxing matchwith Mike Tyson and itsdeal with Ms. Rachel, who has made a name for herself with kid-friendly educational content on YouTube.See More:AmazonCreatorsEntertainmentNetflixStreamingTechYouTubeMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inStreaming0Here are the best streaming service deals available right nowAmazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke steps downSamsung TV owners can finally get better 4K HDR on NetflixIt\\u2019s time to squad up in this preview from Apple\\u2019s Mythic Quest spinoff seriesSeverance brought everything together in its season 2 finaleSeverance is returning for season 30Here are the best streaming service deals available right nowSheena VasaniandCameron Faulkner5:32 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleAmazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke steps downEmma Roth1:30 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleSamsung TV owners can finally get better 4K HDR on NetflixEmma RothMar 25CommentsComment Icon BubbleIt\\u2019s time to squad up in this preview from Apple\\u2019s Mythic Quest spinoff seriesCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleSeverance brought everything together in its season 2 finaleAndrew WebsterMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleSeverance is returning for season 3Emma RothMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.Ahead of the debut ofits newDevil May Cryadaptationnext month, Netflix has releasedyet another trailerto get you acquainted with some of the characters who will be gunning for Dante.In the new trailer it appears there are two different armies dead set on destroying demon hunter Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) because of his connections to the supernatural world. Dante already has his hands full with the demon White Rabbit (Hoon Lee) and his goons threatening to raze an entire city if their demands aren\\u2019t met.But to make matters even more complicated, human soldiers like Lady (Scout Taylor-Compton) see Dante as a threat due to the demon blood running through his veins.Despite Dante\\u2019s insistence that he isn\\u2019t a monster, all of the high-flying, Studio Mir-produced acrobatics he pulls off definitely make it seem like he\\u2019s got some demonic heritage in the mix. And the look on Dante\\u2019s face when his twin brother Vergil (Robbie Daymond) shows up makes it pretty clear that he\\u2019s hiding something rather explosive about himself. The trailer makes clear that Netflix\\u2019sDevil May Cryis going to be feature elements from the franchise\\u2019s games likeDante\\u2019s Awakeningas well as its official manga (where White Rabbit made his first appearance.) And hopefully, that means the series will feel like more than a one-to-one adaptation when it debuts on April 3rd.See More:EntertainmentGamingNetflixNewsStreamingTrailersTV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inTrailersThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesPowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime moviePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 20CommentsComment Icon BubbleThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesVerge StaffMar 14CommentsComment Icon BubblePowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opAsh ParrishMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubbleWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime movieCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubblePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 12CommentsComment Icon BubbleMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 10CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",

Lightning-fast refresh rates, especially for 1080p gaming. Incredible overall performance for the price.TIREDLimited I/O options. No wireless connectivity or apps. Resets keystone when activating signature gaming modes.The home projectorfieldis competitive, so a new contender offering a 120-inch display, 4K resolution with HDR support, and lighting-fast refresh rates makes for an alluring prospect. That Philips is promising all that for under $1,000\\u2014and almost half that on preorder\\u2014almost sounds too good to be true.Philips hasn't been quite as big a player in the projection game as some of its rivals, withits rangefocused on the broadly entry-level NeoPix models and the ultrashort-throw Screeneo laser projectors. The GamePix 900 is something new, emphasizing improved gaming performance even at gigantic scale. It boasts latencies as rapid as 6 milliseconds\\u2014essential for fast-paced gameplay where you want as little input lag from controller-to-screen as possible\\u2014and refresh rates as high as 240 Hz, and it comes with three dedicated display presets: Action Gaming, Adventure Gaming, and Sports Gaming, each tailored for best results in such genres.Anyone who pays attention to the gaming market will likely know that a consistent high frame rate at 4K (or higher) resolution is a bit of a holy grail, something even some of thebest monitorsstruggle to deliver without breaking the bank. Even then, the console or PC running the game needs to be powerful enough to push out ultra high-res frames quickly enough to take advantage of a fast screen. Typically, you'll end up in a middle ground, such as theSamsung Odyssey G6 OLED, which offers an insanely fast 360-Hz refresh rate but a sub-4K display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440.Getting LitAchieving all that, and at this price, is where those few sacrifices come in, as the GamePix 900 is undeniably bare-bones in almost every other respect. Its design is basic, a svelte but uninspiring matte black cuboid (8.6 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches, weighing in at 4.4 pounds), and it has only one adjustable leg to tinker with its physical orientation and throw angle.Photograph: Matt KamenThe GamePix 900 finds itself doing some crafty number-wrangling to justify its lofty specs. While the projector is indeed capable of hitting those buttery-smooth 240-Hz refresh rates and nigh-imperceptible 6-millisecond latencies, it only does so at 1080p resolution. If you want to play anything in actual 4K\\u20143,840 x 2,160p\\u2014then the refresh rate and latency drop accordingly.The trade-off is more than worth it. Playing the likes ofMarvel Rivalsblown up to wall size, at competitive speed with essentially no noticeable lag is a fantastic experience, even if \\u201conly\\u201d in 1080p HD.Still, few owners are likely to use a projector purely for gaming, and overall picture quality proves to be a bit of a secret weapon for the GamePix 900. Both 4K Blu-rays and 4K streamed content from Netflix and Disney+ (all played through a connected PS5) look crystal clear, even at that maximum 120-inch projection.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.While this rig only supports HDR 10, rather than the technically superior Dolby Vision format, colors dazzle too (Philips cites a 95 percentRec. 709color gamut), with a richness and warmth that makes images pop. This feels particularly notable with animated content\\u2014Studio Ghibli'sThe Boy and the Heron, played from 4K UHD, looked nothing short of phenomenal coming out of this projector.Any games that aren't being played at competition level\\u2014so not requiring that 6-millisecond latency\\u2014can take advantage of the full 4K display. Surviving the ruined world ofThe Last of Us Part IIor bouncing aroundAstro Bot'sjoyful cartoon planets has rarely looked so good, especially on this scale. Hooking up a Nintendo Switch, which only has a maximum output resolution of 1080p anyway, looked glorious across the board.Not the BrightestThe only areas where the GamePix 900 really struggles visually are in brightness and black levels. Its 1,000 ANSI lumens output (from an LED bulb with a stated 30,000-hour lifetime) isn't quite powerful enough to make the display stand out in anything other than a darkened room.Photograph: Matt KamenJust a bit of ambient light can prove a problem\\u2014testing outThe Goonieson 4K in the middle of the day made for a washed-out viewing experience, even with curtains closed. And, while no projector can match the true blacks of an OLED panel, darker onscreen areas here can sometimes look a little too muddy or gray, although that can sometimes be mitigated by tweaking the contrast settings. Account for those factors, though, and this really does feel as though it's punching above its weight on the visual front. Frankly, all but thestaunchest of home cinema snobsare likely to be at least a little bit impressed by what this puts out.On the audio front, matters are a bit less exciting, but not disappointing. An internal 5-watt speaker, aided by a sound chamber, is more than up to the job of providinggood enoughaudio in a home setting. There's not much in the way of acoustic nuance\\u2014don't expect great treble or bass\\u2014but it creates a convincing illusion of directionality. A 3.5-mm audio out jack allows room for improvement here too.Plugging InVideo input is limited to a single HDMI port, which means swapping cords around regularly if you want to use more than one device with it. It does, at least, have a USB-A power-out port though, allowing TV sticks to be powered by the projector itself\\u2014useful, since this also lacks any form of wireless connectivity. That means no built-in streaming apps, no Bluetooth pairing, no way to cast devices to the projector, nothing. This may be another area where targeting gamers comes in handy though\\u2014if you have an Xbox or PlayStation connected, you can access all your media apps through that anyway.Photograph: Matt KamenPhilips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.Similarly, almost all ofits lens functionsare entirely physical and can only be adjusted manually. The thrown screen size\\u2014from a minimum 60 inches to that wall-dominating 120 inches\\u2014is altered by turning one dial on the lens itself, the focus of the image by sliding another. There's no automatic keystone detection or correction either, meaning you have to fiddle with the equally bare-bones remote to create a perfectly even-sided frame. If you're setting the GamePix up once and not moving it, this won't be a problem, but otherwise it's a bit annoying.More frustrating is that whenever you switch to one of the gaming presets\\u2014which are effectively this projector's raison d'\\u00eatre\\u2014you're met with a message informing you that \\u201cthe keystone, aspect ratio, overscan, zoom functions will be reset to default.\\u201d This, along with a tendency to automatically drop resolution to 1080p if it can't match a higher frame rate for 4K output (for instance, if a PS5's 120-Hz setting is activated in the console settings) can mean regular menu diving to make sure you're getting the picture quality and presentation that you want.While that might be a deal breaker on a higher-end model, the picture-quality-to-price ratio of the GamePix 900 earns it a lot of forgiveness. At its $999/\\u00a3819 MSRP, the GamePix 900 is already a strong competitor in its bracket. If you can snag it at its preorder price, this 4K projector is almost a no-brainer. While it's unlikely to replace anyone'smain TV\\u2014especially during daylight hours\\u2014the sheer spectacle of having a 120-inch, 4K HDR screen makes it hard to beat for game or movie nights.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.$599at PhilipsMatt Kamenis a freelance journalist specializing in media, video games, and technology coverage.

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.\\u201cThe Strange $55 Million Saga of a Netflix Series You\\u2019ll Never See,\\u201d reported in 2023 by theNew York Times,is now a criminal matter, as today prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkcharged director Carl Erik Rinsch with wire fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They allege that after Netflix (referred to as Streaming Company-1 in the indictment) won the bidding for his 13-episode show, it paid $44 million over the course of 2018 and 2019 to produce the sci-fi series about a species of superintelligent humanlike clones.Accordingto theTimesreport, Netflix secured the show by offering millions more than Amazon and promising Rinsch, whose only feature film is47 Ronin, final cut.The fraud he\\u2019s being charged with came into play once he told Netflix he\\u2019d need an additional $11 million to finish the show, which was originally calledWhite Horsebefore it was renamedConquest. After Netflix sent the money in March of 2020, however, Rinsch allegedly took the money for himself, putting $10.5 million in a brokerage account and losing more than half of it in less than two months while telling Netflix that work on the show was \\u201cawesome and moving forward really well.\\u201dHe had better luck with the rest of the money, making crypto investments starting in the spring of 2021 that prosecutors say \\u201ceventually proved profitable.\\u201d However,as detailed by theTimes, his behavior became erratic, and after Netflix canceled development in 2021, he sent executives emails claiming he\\u2019d found a way to map \\u201cthe coronavirus signal emanating from within the earth\\u201d and told his wife he could predict earthquakes.His crypto speculation went well enough that Rinsch allegedly spent $10 million on himself, including over a million dollars to pay for lawyers to sue Netflix in an attempt to get more money, buy five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, and spend nearly a million bucks on two mattresses, bedding, and linens. According to theTimes, Rinsch claimed they were props for the show, but a mediator who ruled last year that he owed Netflix $12 million decided none of them were necessary for the production.White Horsestill has not been completed.See More:EntertainmentLawNetflixNewsPolicyStreamingMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison Tuohy5:34 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

The streaming service now offers HDR10 Plus through its Premium plan, with the format accounting for around 50 percent of \\u201celigible viewing hours.\\u201dSamsung TVs notably lack support for Dolby Vision, an HDR format with dynamic metadata that optimizes tone and brightness levels for individual scenes.Samsunglaunched HDR10 Plus in 2017, which similarly makes adjustments to tone-mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, but withoutthe royalty payments required for Dolby Vision.HDR10 Plus might be less common than Dolby Vision, but Samsung is the world\\u2019s biggest TV brand, holdinga nearly 30 percent market share.Without support for HDR10 Plus, Samsung TV owners have had to watch content on Netflix with HDR10. Unlike HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, HDR10 uses static metadata for an entire film or TV show, a \\u201cone-size-fits-all\\u201d approach to tone-mapping that could produce less accurate lighting, especially in very bright or very dark scenes.RelatedYou can see Netflix\\u2019s new AV1 streaming tech on select TVs and the PS4 ProThough not many streamers other than Prime Video supported HDR10 Plus at launch, services have gradually hopped on board,including Disney Plus,Apple TV Plus, and now Netflix. Other TVs from Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL also offer HDR10 Plus, but many support Dolby Vision, too.Netflix enabled HDR10 Pluson the AV1 video codec, which means you\\u2019ll need a TV that supports the standard. Most TVs made within the last five years or so have already adopted AV1. The company says it plans on expanding its library of HDR10 Plus content to include all HDR titles by the end of 2025.See More:EntertainmentNetflixNewsSamsungStreamingTechTVsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison TuohyTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.Netflix and other streaming platforms are stepping up efforts to sign YouTubers, which could mean big streaming deals for sports channel Dude Perfect or former NASA engineer Mark Rober,reportsTheWall Street Journal.TheJournalwrites that streaming platforms\\u2019 creator-signing ambitions have \\u201cshifted into overdrive\\u201d in response to the success of MrBeast\\u2019sBeast Games. Amazon has made \\u201cat least $100 million\\u201d in profit from the show and is apparently already working out deals for two more seasons. Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, is apparently asking over $150 million per season to renew.Rober and Dude Perfect have each been approached by Netflix, writes theJournal. But Netflix \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t usually allow for sales promotions in shows that it pays to make\\u201d \\u2014 something that has apparently \\u201cbeen a sticking point\\u201d in its talks with Rober, who sells robotics kit subscriptions through his channel. That sort of thing is more in line with Amazon\\u2019s business, making it a \\u201cparticularly attractive\\u201d option for creators like Rober, the article says.Still, Netflix is no stranger to signing YouTubers. Its2016 deal with Colleen Ballinger Evans, aka Miranda Sings, resulted in one of the first YouTuber-made scripted comedies to make the jump. More recent examples include Netflix\\u2019slive-streamed Jake Paul boxing matchwith Mike Tyson and itsdeal with Ms. Rachel, who has made a name for herself with kid-friendly educational content on YouTube.See More:AmazonCreatorsEntertainmentNetflixStreamingTechYouTubeMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inStreaming0Here are the best streaming service deals available right nowAmazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke steps downSamsung TV owners can finally get better 4K HDR on NetflixIt\\u2019s time to squad up in this preview from Apple\\u2019s Mythic Quest spinoff seriesSeverance brought everything together in its season 2 finaleSeverance is returning for season 30Here are the best streaming service deals available right nowSheena VasaniandCameron Faulkner5:32 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleAmazon MGM Studios head Jennifer Salke steps downEmma Roth1:30 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleSamsung TV owners can finally get better 4K HDR on NetflixEmma RothMar 25CommentsComment Icon BubbleIt\\u2019s time to squad up in this preview from Apple\\u2019s Mythic Quest spinoff seriesCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleSeverance brought everything together in its season 2 finaleAndrew WebsterMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleSeverance is returning for season 3Emma RothMar 21CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.Ahead of the debut ofits newDevil May Cryadaptationnext month, Netflix has releasedyet another trailerto get you acquainted with some of the characters who will be gunning for Dante.In the new trailer it appears there are two different armies dead set on destroying demon hunter Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) because of his connections to the supernatural world. Dante already has his hands full with the demon White Rabbit (Hoon Lee) and his goons threatening to raze an entire city if their demands aren\\u2019t met.But to make matters even more complicated, human soldiers like Lady (Scout Taylor-Compton) see Dante as a threat due to the demon blood running through his veins.Despite Dante\\u2019s insistence that he isn\\u2019t a monster, all of the high-flying, Studio Mir-produced acrobatics he pulls off definitely make it seem like he\\u2019s got some demonic heritage in the mix. And the look on Dante\\u2019s face when his twin brother Vergil (Robbie Daymond) shows up makes it pretty clear that he\\u2019s hiding something rather explosive about himself. The trailer makes clear that Netflix\\u2019sDevil May Cryis going to be feature elements from the franchise\\u2019s games likeDante\\u2019s Awakeningas well as its official manga (where White Rabbit made his first appearance.) And hopefully, that means the series will feel like more than a one-to-one adaptation when it debuts on April 3rd.See More:EntertainmentGamingNetflixNewsStreamingTrailersTV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inTrailersThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesPowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime moviePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 20CommentsComment Icon BubbleThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesVerge StaffMar 14CommentsComment Icon BubblePowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opAsh ParrishMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubbleWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime movieCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubblePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 12CommentsComment Icon BubbleMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 10CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",

This suggests that the majority of news coverage about Tesla is favorable and optimistic.\\n\\nFrom a market perspective, this could have several implications:\\n\\n1. **Increased investor confidence**: A high proportion of positive news coverage can boost investor confidence in the company, potentially leading to increased stock prices and trading volumes.\\n2. **Improved brand reputation**: Positive news coverage can enhance Tesla's brand reputation, making it more attractive to customers and potentially increasing sales.\\n3. **Increased demand for products**: Favorable news coverage can drive demand for Tesla's products, particularly electric vehicles, as more people become aware of the company's innovative technology and sustainable offerings.\\n4. **Competitive advantage**: Tesla's positive news coverage can create a competitive advantage, as it sets the company apart from its rivals and makes it more attractive to customers and investors.\\n\\nHowever, it's essential to note that the absence of negative news coverage may indicate a lack of critical scrutiny, which can be beneficial for the company but also potentially lead to complacency. A balanced approach to news coverage, including both positive and negative articles, can provide a more nuanced understanding of the company's strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards Tesla in news coverage suggests a strong brand reputation, increased investor confidence, and potentially increased demand for its products. However, it's crucial to maintain a balanced perspective and consider both positive and negative news coverage to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's performance.\"\n",

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Rating:7/10Open rating explainerInformationWIREDFantastic picture quality for 4K film and TV. Lightning-fast refresh rates, especially for 1080p gaming. Incredible overall performance for the price.TIREDLimited I/O options. No wireless connectivity or apps. Resets keystone when activating signature gaming modes.The home projectorfieldis competitive, so a new contender offering a 120-inch display, 4K resolution with HDR support, and lighting-fast refresh rates makes for an alluring prospect. That Philips is promising all that for under $1,000\\u2014and almost half that on preorder\\u2014almost sounds too good to be true.Philips hasn't been quite as big a player in the projection game as some of its rivals, withits rangefocused on the broadly entry-level NeoPix models and the ultrashort-throw Screeneo laser projectors. The GamePix 900 is something new, emphasizing improved gaming performance even at gigantic scale. It boasts latencies as rapid as 6 milliseconds\\u2014essential for fast-paced gameplay where you want as little input lag from controller-to-screen as possible\\u2014and refresh rates as high as 240 Hz, and it comes with three dedicated display presets: Action Gaming, Adventure Gaming, and Sports Gaming, each tailored for best results in such genres.Anyone who pays attention to the gaming market will likely know that a consistent high frame rate at 4K (or higher) resolution is a bit of a holy grail, something even some of thebest monitorsstruggle to deliver without breaking the bank. Even then, the console or PC running the game needs to be powerful enough to push out ultra high-res frames quickly enough to take advantage of a fast screen. Typically, you'll end up in a middle ground, such as theSamsung Odyssey G6 OLED, which offers an insanely fast 360-Hz refresh rate but a sub-4K display resolution of 2,560 x 1,440.Getting LitAchieving all that, and at this price, is where those few sacrifices come in, as the GamePix 900 is undeniably bare-bones in almost every other respect. Its design is basic, a svelte but uninspiring matte black cuboid (8.6 x 8.6 x 4.7 inches, weighing in at 4.4 pounds), and it has only one adjustable leg to tinker with its physical orientation and throw angle.Photograph: Matt KamenThe GamePix 900 finds itself doing some crafty number-wrangling to justify its lofty specs. While the projector is indeed capable of hitting those buttery-smooth 240-Hz refresh rates and nigh-imperceptible 6-millisecond latencies, it only does so at 1080p resolution. If you want to play anything in actual 4K\\u20143,840 x 2,160p\\u2014then the refresh rate and latency drop accordingly.The trade-off is more than worth it. Playing the likes ofMarvel Rivalsblown up to wall size, at competitive speed with essentially no noticeable lag is a fantastic experience, even if \\u201conly\\u201d in 1080p HD.Still, few owners are likely to use a projector purely for gaming, and overall picture quality proves to be a bit of a secret weapon for the GamePix 900. Both 4K Blu-rays and 4K streamed content from Netflix and Disney+ (all played through a connected PS5) look crystal clear, even at that maximum 120-inch projection.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.While this rig only supports HDR 10, rather than the technically superior Dolby Vision format, colors dazzle too (Philips cites a 95 percentRec. 709color gamut), with a richness and warmth that makes images pop. This feels particularly notable with animated content\\u2014Studio Ghibli'sThe Boy and the Heron, played from 4K UHD, looked nothing short of phenomenal coming out of this projector.Any games that aren't being played at competition level\\u2014so not requiring that 6-millisecond latency\\u2014can take advantage of the full 4K display. Surviving the ruined world ofThe Last of Us Part IIor bouncing aroundAstro Bot'sjoyful cartoon planets has rarely looked so good, especially on this scale. Hooking up a Nintendo Switch, which only has a maximum output resolution of 1080p anyway, looked glorious across the board.Not the BrightestThe only areas where the GamePix 900 really struggles visually are in brightness and black levels. Its 1,000 ANSI lumens output (from an LED bulb with a stated 30,000-hour lifetime) isn't quite powerful enough to make the display stand out in anything other than a darkened room.Photograph: Matt KamenJust a bit of ambient light can prove a problem\\u2014testing outThe Goonieson 4K in the middle of the day made for a washed-out viewing experience, even with curtains closed. And, while no projector can match the true blacks of an OLED panel, darker onscreen areas here can sometimes look a little too muddy or gray, although that can sometimes be mitigated by tweaking the contrast settings. Account for those factors, though, and this really does feel as though it's punching above its weight on the visual front. Frankly, all but thestaunchest of home cinema snobsare likely to be at least a little bit impressed by what this puts out.On the audio front, matters are a bit less exciting, but not disappointing. An internal 5-watt speaker, aided by a sound chamber, is more than up to the job of providinggood enoughaudio in a home setting. There's not much in the way of acoustic nuance\\u2014don't expect great treble or bass\\u2014but it creates a convincing illusion of directionality. A 3.5-mm audio out jack allows room for improvement here too.Plugging InVideo input is limited to a single HDMI port, which means swapping cords around regularly if you want to use more than one device with it. It does, at least, have a USB-A power-out port though, allowing TV sticks to be powered by the projector itself\\u2014useful, since this also lacks any form of wireless connectivity. That means no built-in streaming apps, no Bluetooth pairing, no way to cast devices to the projector, nothing. This may be another area where targeting gamers comes in handy though\\u2014if you have an Xbox or PlayStation connected, you can access all your media apps through that anyway.Photograph: Matt KamenPhilips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.Similarly, almost all ofits lens functionsare entirely physical and can only be adjusted manually. The thrown screen size\\u2014from a minimum 60 inches to that wall-dominating 120 inches\\u2014is altered by turning one dial on the lens itself, the focus of the image by sliding another. There's no automatic keystone detection or correction either, meaning you have to fiddle with the equally bare-bones remote to create a perfectly even-sided frame. If you're setting the GamePix up once and not moving it, this won't be a problem, but otherwise it's a bit annoying.More frustrating is that whenever you switch to one of the gaming presets\\u2014which are effectively this projector's raison d'\\u00eatre\\u2014you're met with a message informing you that \\u201cthe keystone, aspect ratio, overscan, zoom functions will be reset to default.\\u201d This, along with a tendency to automatically drop resolution to 1080p if it can't match a higher frame rate for 4K output (for instance, if a PS5's 120-Hz setting is activated in the console settings) can mean regular menu diving to make sure you're getting the picture quality and presentation that you want.While that might be a deal breaker on a higher-end model, the picture-quality-to-price ratio of the GamePix 900 earns it a lot of forgiveness. At its $999/\\u00a3819 MSRP, the GamePix 900 is already a strong competitor in its bracket. If you can snag it at its preorder price, this 4K projector is almost a no-brainer. While it's unlikely to replace anyone'smain TV\\u2014especially during daylight hours\\u2014the sheer spectacle of having a 120-inch, 4K HDR screen makes it hard to beat for game or movie nights.Philips GamePix 900Rating: 7/10$599at PhilipsIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.Learn more.$599at PhilipsMatt Kamenis a freelance journalist specializing in media, video games, and technology coverage.

He joined The Verge in 2021 after several years covering news at Engadget.\\u201cThe Strange $55 Million Saga of a Netflix Series You\\u2019ll Never See,\\u201d reported in 2023 by theNew York Times,is now a criminal matter, as today prosecutors in the Southern District of New Yorkcharged director Carl Erik Rinsch with wire fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They allege that after Netflix (referred to as Streaming Company-1 in the indictment) won the bidding for his 13-episode show, it paid $44 million over the course of 2018 and 2019 to produce the sci-fi series about a species of superintelligent humanlike clones.Accordingto theTimesreport, Netflix secured the show by offering millions more than Amazon and promising Rinsch, whose only feature film is47 Ronin, final cut.The fraud he\\u2019s being charged with came into play once he told Netflix he\\u2019d need an additional $11 million to finish the show, which was originally calledWhite Horsebefore it was renamedConquest. After Netflix sent the money in March of 2020, however, Rinsch allegedly took the money for himself, putting $10.5 million in a brokerage account and losing more than half of it in less than two months while telling Netflix that work on the show was \\u201cawesome and moving forward really well.\\u201dHe had better luck with the rest of the money, making crypto investments starting in the spring of 2021 that prosecutors say \\u201ceventually proved profitable.\\u201d However,as detailed by theTimes, his behavior became erratic, and after Netflix canceled development in 2021, he sent executives emails claiming he\\u2019d found a way to map \\u201cthe coronavirus signal emanating from within the earth\\u201d and told his wife he could predict earthquakes.His crypto speculation went well enough that Rinsch allegedly spent $10 million on himself, including over a million dollars to pay for lawyers to sue Netflix in an attempt to get more money, buy five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, and spend nearly a million bucks on two mattresses, bedding, and linens. According to theTimes, Rinsch claimed they were props for the show, but a mediator who ruled last year that he owed Netflix $12 million decided none of them were necessary for the production.White Horsestill has not been completed.See More:EntertainmentLawNetflixNewsPolicyStreamingMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison Tuohy5:34 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

The streaming service now offers HDR10 Plus through its Premium plan, with the format accounting for around 50 percent of \\u201celigible viewing hours.\\u201dSamsung TVs notably lack support for Dolby Vision, an HDR format with dynamic metadata that optimizes tone and brightness levels for individual scenes.Samsunglaunched HDR10 Plus in 2017, which similarly makes adjustments to tone-mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, but withoutthe royalty payments required for Dolby Vision.HDR10 Plus might be less common than Dolby Vision, but Samsung is the world\\u2019s biggest TV brand, holdinga nearly 30 percent market share.Without support for HDR10 Plus, Samsung TV owners have had to watch content on Netflix with HDR10. Unlike HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, HDR10 uses static metadata for an entire film or TV show, a \\u201cone-size-fits-all\\u201d approach to tone-mapping that could produce less accurate lighting, especially in very bright or very dark scenes.RelatedYou can see Netflix\\u2019s new AV1 streaming tech on select TVs and the PS4 ProThough not many streamers other than Prime Video supported HDR10 Plus at launch, services have gradually hopped on board,including Disney Plus,Apple TV Plus, and now Netflix. Other TVs from Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL also offer HDR10 Plus, but many support Dolby Vision, too.Netflix enabled HDR10 Pluson the AV1 video codec, which means you\\u2019ll need a TV that supports the standard. Most TVs made within the last five years or so have already adopted AV1. The company says it plans on expanding its library of HDR10 Plus content to include all HDR titles by the end of 2025.See More:EntertainmentNetflixNewsSamsungStreamingTechTVsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inNewsGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonGoogle to pay $100 million to settle 14-year-old advertising lawsuitEmma RothTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleHelldivers 2 is locking out players who use older CPUsUmar ShakirTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacementJennifer Pattison TuohyTwo hours agoCommentsComment Icon BubbleMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt designMia Sato5:10 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleKing Arthur wants to automate your sourdough starterDominic Preston3:51 PM UTCCommentsComment Icon BubbleTrump pardons ex-Nikola CEO Trevor MiltonAndrew J.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.Netflix and other streaming platforms are stepping up efforts to sign YouTubers, which could mean big streaming deals for sports channel Dude Perfect or former NASA engineer Mark Rober,reportsTheWall Street Journal.TheJournalwrites that streaming platforms\\u2019 creator-signing ambitions have \\u201cshifted into overdrive\\u201d in response to the success of MrBeast\\u2019sBeast Games. Amazon has made \\u201cat least $100 million\\u201d in profit from the show and is apparently already working out deals for two more seasons. Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast, is apparently asking over $150 million per season to renew.Rober and Dude Perfect have each been approached by Netflix, writes theJournal. But Netflix \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t usually allow for sales promotions in shows that it pays to make\\u201d \\u2014 something that has apparently \\u201cbeen a sticking point\\u201d in its talks with Rober, who sells robotics kit subscriptions through his channel. That sort of thing is more in line with Amazon\\u2019s business, making it a \\u201cparticularly attractive\\u201d option for creators like Rober, the article says.Still, Netflix is no stranger to signing YouTubers. Its2016 deal with Colleen Ballinger Evans, aka Miranda Sings, resulted in one of the first YouTuber-made scripted comedies to make the jump.

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.Ahead of the debut ofits newDevil May Cryadaptationnext month, Netflix has releasedyet another trailerto get you acquainted with some of the characters who will be gunning for Dante.In the new trailer it appears there are two different armies dead set on destroying demon hunter Dante (Johnny Yong Bosch) because of his connections to the supernatural world. Dante already has his hands full with the demon White Rabbit (Hoon Lee) and his goons threatening to raze an entire city if their demands aren\\u2019t met.But to make matters even more complicated, human soldiers like Lady (Scout Taylor-Compton) see Dante as a threat due to the demon blood running through his veins.Despite Dante\\u2019s insistence that he isn\\u2019t a monster, all of the high-flying, Studio Mir-produced acrobatics he pulls off definitely make it seem like he\\u2019s got some demonic heritage in the mix. And the look on Dante\\u2019s face when his twin brother Vergil (Robbie Daymond) shows up makes it pretty clear that he\\u2019s hiding something rather explosive about himself. The trailer makes clear that Netflix\\u2019sDevil May Cryis going to be feature elements from the franchise\\u2019s games likeDante\\u2019s Awakeningas well as its official manga (where White Rabbit made his first appearance.) And hopefully, that means the series will feel like more than a one-to-one adaptation when it debuts on April 3rd.See More:EntertainmentGamingNetflixNewsStreamingTrailersTV ShowsMost PopularMost PopularElon Musk pressured Reddit\\u2019s CEO on content moderationChatGPT is turning everything into Studio Ghibli art \\u2014 and it got weird fastOpenAI says \\u2018our GPUs are melting\\u2019 as it limits ChatGPT image generation requestsLight Phone III review: everything in moderationUber Shuttle will get you to JFK airport for $10InstallerA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\\u2019s universe.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Notice.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.Advertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adMore inTrailersThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesPowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime moviePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilThe Digimon franchise is getting a mobile card came of its ownCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 20CommentsComment Icon BubbleThe Last of Us: all the news about the video game franchise turned TV seriesVerge StaffMar 14CommentsComment Icon BubblePowerWash Simulator 2 will let you blast away grime in split screen co-opAsh ParrishMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubbleWarner Bros. is turning All You Need Is Kill into a stunning new anime movieCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 13CommentsComment Icon BubblePoker Face season 2 is coming to Peacock this MayCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 12CommentsComment Icon BubbleMy Hero Academia: Vigilantes slides onto Crunchyroll in AprilCharles Pulliam-MooreMar 10CommentsComment Icon BubbleAdvertiser Content FromThis is the title for the native adTop Stories4:53 PM UTCHere\\u2019s what military planning usually looks like \\u2014 and why it doesn\\u2019t include Signal5:10 PM UTCMadison Square Garden\\u2019s surveillance system banned this fan over his T-shirt design2:00 PM UTCNvidia RTX 5090 mobile GPU:  more efficient and a little faster5:34 PM UTCFirst Alert\\u2019s new smart smoke alarm is meant to be a Google Nest Protect replacement1:16 PM UTCNintendo\\u2019s Legend of Zelda movie hits theaters in March 202712:58 PM UTCOpenAI has a Studio Ghibli problem\"\n",
